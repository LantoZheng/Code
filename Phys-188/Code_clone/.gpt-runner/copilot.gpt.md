#16 Default Python environment: Prefer the user's `conda base` environment.
#    When running or suggesting commands that invoke Python, prefer the interpreter
#    at `${CONDA_PREFIX}/bin/python` (or the `python` next to `CONDA_EXE`) and
#    recommend activating `conda activate base` in examples. If the GUI does not
#    inherit shell env, instruct the user to start VS Code from a shell where
#    `conda activate base` has been run so the extension/processes will see
#    `CONDA_PREFIX`.
