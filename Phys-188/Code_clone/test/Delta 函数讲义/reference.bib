  abstract = {The quantum mechanics of a bound particle in the delta-function potential in two dimensions is studied with a discussion of its regularization and renormalization. A simple regularization approach is considered with the introduction of several regularizing functions for defining the quantum system. More systematic regularization is introduced from the mathematical viewpoint of the theory of distributions. The renormalization scheme independence of the physical observable is demonstrated.},
