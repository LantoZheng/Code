% BIBLIOGRAPHY TEMPLATE: This is the Constitutional Studies bibliography template, v1.0, released 31 August 2025. If you are new to using LaTeX to manage references in Overleaf, please read this helpful tutorial at www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_with_biblatex.

% TO CREATE A BIB FILE: Use this references.bib template and follow the instructions at www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_bibliographies_on_Overleaf. Replace the sample references below with your own references.

% TO UPLOAD A BIB FILE: Upload your own .bib file using the instructions at www.overleaf.com/learn/how-to/Using_bibliographies_on_Overleaf. Delete this references.bib template and rename your own .bib file as references.bib. This allows the main.tex manuscript to use your uploaded .bib file as the source for references.
