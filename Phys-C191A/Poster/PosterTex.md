### **Column 1: The Quest for Public Verification**

1.  **After the text in "1. Motivation: The Dream of Unclonable Cash" describing the difference between private and public-key schemes:**
    * **Purpose:** To visually contrast the verification processes. A diagram could show a user interacting with a "Trusted Bank" (private-key) versus a user interacting with a "Public Verification Circuit" (public-key).
    * **Insertion Point:** After the paragraph starting with "In contrast, public-key quantum money allows anyone to verify...".

### **Column 2: The Physics & Construction (The Core)**

2.  **After the text in "3. The 'Win-Win' Framework":**
    * **Purpose:** To illustrate Zhandry's dichotomy as a flowchart. A simple diagram could show a decision point: "Is the Hash Collapsing?" with two branches leading to "Yes (Collapsing)" and "No (Quantum Lightning)".
    * **Insertion Point:** After the bullet point describing the "Not collapsing" case.

### **Column 3: Limitations & Conclusion**

3.  **After the text in "6. The Inflation Problem" describing the "Cloning-Generation Dichotomy":**
    * **Purpose:** To visually represent the difference in difficulty between cloning and minting. A diagram could show a "Cloning" path with an obstacle (representing the hard multi-collision problem) leading to a specific bolt, and a "Minting" path with no obstacle leading to a random new bolt. This would complement the existing "Money Supply vs. Time" graph.
    * **Insertion Point:** After the text explaining the dichotomy.

4.  **After the text in "7. Conclusion" summarizing the scheme's properties:**
    * **Purpose:** To visualize the core metaphor of the conclusion. A diagram could show one panel with lightning not striking the same spot twice (representing uniqueness/no-cloning), and another panel with lightning striking multiple random spots (representing unbounded generation/inflation).
    * **Insertion Point:** After the bullet point starting with "However, public verification implies public generation...".
