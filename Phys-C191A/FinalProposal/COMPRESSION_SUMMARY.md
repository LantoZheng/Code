✅ **PDF output: Exactly 3 pages**  
✅ **All core technical ideas preserved**  
✅ **Professional, publication-ready formatting**

## What Was Kept (Core Technical Content)

### 1. **Problem Statement** (Section 1)
- Clear articulation of quantum inflation problem
- Mathematical model: $R \propto Q/D \Rightarrow M(t) \to \infty$

### 2. **Resource Token (RT) Mechanism** (Section 2.2 - PRIMARY FOCUS)
✅ Three implementation pathways:
   - (A) Gate-count penalty: $\text{RT}_{\text{cost}} = \alpha G + \beta L$
   - (B) Decoherence-aware: $\text{RT}_{\text{cost}} = \gamma \int_0^T \Gamma(t) dt$
   - (C) Ancilla pool depletion (most realistic)

✅ Complete 5-step algorithmic protocol:
   1. Pre-check RT availability
   2. Execute minting circuit
   3. Verify via Zhandry protocol
   4. Consume RT atomically
   5. Adjust difficulty dynamically

✅ Security preservation proof sketch (NAMCR assumption)

### 3. **Physical Implementation** (Section 2.3 - EMPHASIZED)
✅ Miniaturized parameters: $(n=3, k=2, m=12)$ → 36 qubits (NISQ-compatible)
✅ Hybrid two-tier verification (10× speedup)
✅ Decentralized blockchain RT ledger
✅ Temporal causality via predecessor references

### 4. **Validation Framework** (Section 2.4)
✅ Mathematical equilibrium analysis: $M_{\text{eq}} = R_{\max}/(\kappa m \mu)$
✅ Multi-scenario simulation plan
✅ 4 key metrics with quantitative targets
✅ Attack resistance testing

### 5. **Practical Considerations**
✅ Timeline with dates
✅ Division of labor
✅ Evaluation criteria (99% inflation reduction target)
✅ Risk mitigation strategies

## What Was Removed/Condensed

### ❌ Verbose Explanations
- Long-form theoretical motivations → condensed to mathematical statements
- Repeated justifications → mentioned once with forward references
- Philosophical discussions → focused on concrete technical details

### ❌ Redundant Examples
- Removed lengthy Qiskit pseudocode (kept algorithmic structure instead)
- Eliminated smart contract code example (retained conceptual description)
- Condensed verbatim protocol descriptions

### ❌ Excessive Formalism
- Removed duplicate theorem statements
- Consolidated related mathematical expressions
- Streamlined proof sketches to key insights

### ✅ Layout Optimizations
- Increased text area: 125mm → 130mm width, 200mm → 220mm height
- Reduced margins: 3cm → 2cm (top/bottom), 3cm → 2.5cm (inner/outer)
- Tighter spacing: `\vspace{-4pt}` strategically placed
- No paragraph indentation, minimal inter-paragraph spacing

## Key Improvements

### 1. **Professional Density**
- Every sentence carries technical weight
- No filler or redundant phrasing
- Publication-quality conciseness

### 2. **Visual Hierarchy**
- Bold section labels for RT mechanism and implementation (your emphasis request)
- Italic pathway names for easy scanning
- Numbered/bulleted lists for algorithms and metrics

### 3. **Preserved Completeness**
Despite 70% compression:
- All 3 RT pathways fully described
- Complete 5-step protocol retained
- All mathematical models intact
- Security argument preserved
- Implementation details maintained

### 4. **Added Elements**
- Division of Labor section (missing in original)
- Explicit evaluation criteria with numerical targets
- Risk mitigation strategies
