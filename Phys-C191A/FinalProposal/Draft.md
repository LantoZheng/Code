# Final project proposal: Quantum money 
Submilestones
## Introduction 
### Part 1: Justify that the inflation is unlimited with a simulation.
### Part 2: Implementation and design for limiting inflation
We know that inflation of Quantum money can depend on some variables like Quantum

#### 2.1: Find an existing model that could work to improve, try to explain and prove this model will cause an infinite inflation rate when the speed of QC goes to exponential.
#### 2.2: Improve that model to limit the inflation. (To be specified)
#### 2.3: Discuss if the model would be possible in the physical world. : For example, discuss if the model we improved is applicable to a quantum circuit.  
### Part 3: Test the improved model with simulation (Is it safe in theory? Will it improve the situation of inflation?): (with the simulation we used for the first part)
### Part 4: Conclusion.
Also, please draft the direction and timeline based on our sub milestones, handout, and the files we attached for the project
Lastly, try to use the template that I gave
